## Fiscal Discipline Divide: Northern vs Southern Europe

In my redesign of OECD Government Debt Heatmap (2007–2024) , I wanted to highlight the contrast in fiscal discipline between Northern and Southern Europe using the same OECD debt-to-GDP data. By grouping countries into two regions, I aimed to show how Northern Europe has generally maintained lower and more stable debt levels, while Southern Europe continues to struggle with higher debt after the 2008 crisis and COVID-19. The dual-line design—thin country lines and bold regional averages—helps viewers see both individual patterns and overall regional trends.

Compared with my heatmap, this version tells a clearer story instead of just showing values. The heatmap worked well for broad comparisons, but the line chart emphasizes how two regions diverged over time. I used teal for Northern Europe and orange for Southern Europe to convey stability versus risk, and added a dashed 100 % line to mark the debt threshold. Overall, this design is more effective in communicating the long-term fiscal gap between the two regions.
