# The Final Data Story
[Slidedeck](https://preview.shorthand.com/i9ywfHkKNbB38rV4)

In just a few years, artificial intelligence has moved from the sidelines into everyday routines. As adoption grows around the world, a clear tension is emerging between how people currently use AI and what they actually hope it could do for them.

This story follows that tension. It begins with the rapid rise of AI users and the growing familiarity Americans have with tools like ChatGPT. It then looks at who is using AI, the tasks they rely on it for, and where usage still feels limited. Many adults stay within basic text-to-text interactions, even though they’re curious about richer formats such as images, audio, and video.

From there, the narrative turns to what people wish AI could offer—support with daily productivity, help automating routine tasks, and a sense of having a reliable digital assistant. At the same time, most individuals report feeling that they have only a little control over how AI is incorporated into their lives.

The final chapters look ahead, highlighting practical tools that people can start using today. These examples—whether simplifying job applications, organizing study materials, or capturing meeting notes—show how AI can meaningfully lighten everyday workloads.

Together, the presentation shows a public that is hopeful but still figuring things out: excited about the possibilities, unsure about the boundaries, and eager for guidance. That’s where the call to action comes in: an invitation to explore AI more intentionally, choose tools that genuinely support personal and professional goals, and take the first steps toward using AI in a way that feels purposeful rather than accidental.

# Changes made since Part II
- **Refined target audience**  
  Shifted the story explicitly toward *graduate students*, based on interview feedback suggesting they would benefit most from practical, actionable AI guidance.

- **Tightened narrative flow**  
  Shortened dense text sections—especially the part on the 68% text-to-text usage—and added clearer transitions to guide readers from current behaviors to future aspirations.

- **Improved visual pacing**  
  Broke long paragraphs into smaller blocks and added brief section headers to make the storyline easier to follow.

- **Strengthened call to action**  
  Made the final section more specific by offering direct next steps and tool suggestions that help students close the gap between intent and actual AI use

## The audience
- **Focused on graduate students**  
  Interviews showed they are aware of AI but often unsure how to use it effectively.

- **Interview insights shaped the scope**  
  Students expressed needs around productivity, assignment planning, and job applications.

- **Persona: “Overwhelmed graduate student”**  
  Helped anchor the story to readers juggling coursework, recruiting, and daily tasks.

- **Adjusted tone and examples**  
  Narrative and recommendations were rewritten to directly address real student workflows.

## Final design decisions
- **Simplified and tightened text**  
  Reduced dense sections and clarified transitions for smoother reading.

- **Improved pacing and structure**  
  Broke long text into shorter parts and added light section headers.

- **Strengthened the call to action**  
  Ended with specific AI tool with demo video showing how it can help us, providing huge motivation for the audiences to use it.
