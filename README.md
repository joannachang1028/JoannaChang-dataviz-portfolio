# About me  
As a life-long learner, my journey from fast-moving consumer goods to medical devices and ultimately pharmaceuticals has been a deliberate path to deepen my understanding of healthcare. With five years of experience across Johnson & Johnson and Merck KGaA, I have immersed myself in anatomy and surgical procedures to support surgeons with targeted solutions and expanded my focus to oncology, gaining a holistic view of the patient journey. These experiences ignited my passion for healthcare policy and analytics and convinced me of the power of data to improve patient outcomes.  

I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Health Care Analytics & Information Technology at Carnegie Mellon University (May 2026) to refine my analytical skills and broaden my impact on patient care. My academic work builds on hands-on industry experience by developing competencies in statistics, machine learning, database management, and data visualization. I am actively seeking a data scientist position starting in July 2026 where I can apply these skills to patient‑centered problems.  

Outside of work and study, I'm a strength training enthusiast and avid learner of nutrition and physiology. Whether I'm tracking my macros in the gym or analyzing healthcare datasets, my approach is intentional and thorough. I love connecting with others who are interested in the intersection of healthcare, data science and patient centered care, and I'm always eager to explore new opportunities and learn from peers.  

# What I hope to learn  
- **Using Tableau to visualize data** – gaining proficiency in Tableau so I can build interactive dashboards and communicate insights clearly.  
- **Learning different perspectives on how to critique visualizations and be creative in improving them** – developing a critical eye for design and learning to iterate on visualizations using feedback from peers.  
- **Developing clear, compelling narratives with data and conducting user research to ensure those stories resonate** – based on the syllabus, I'm especially interested in crafting persuasive narratives for specific audiences and using user research to make sure my visualizations are effective.  

# Portfolio  
Below are placeholders for the assignments and final project I'll complete during the course. I'll update these links as I finish each deliverable.  

## Assignment 1: Visualizing Government Debt  
[Visualizing Government Debt](visualizing-government-debt)  

In this assignment I'll explore government debt data and create a visualization that tells an insightful story about debt trends. I'll set up a new page for this assignment and link it here.  

## Assignment 3  & 4: Critique by Design  
[Critique by Design](critique-by-design)  

This assignment will focus on critiquing an existing visualization and redesigning it for clarity and impact. I'll provide my critique and redesigned visualization on the linked page.  

## Final project  
Stay tuned for my final project! I'll use the tools and techniques learned in this course to create a comprehensive data storytelling piece. I'll provide a high-level description and link once the project is underway.
