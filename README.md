# About me  
As a life-long learner, my journey from fast-moving consumer goods to medical devices and ultimately pharmaceuticals has been a deliberate path to deepen my understanding of healthcare. With five years of experience across Johnson & Johnson and Merck KGaA, I have immersed myself in anatomy and surgical procedures to support surgeons with targeted solutions and expanded my focus to oncology, gaining a holistic view of the patient journey. These experiences ignited my passion for healthcare policy and analytics and convinced me of the power of data to improve patient outcomes.  

I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Health Care Analytics & Information Technology at Carnegie Mellon University (May 2026) to refine my analytical skills and broaden my impact on patient care. My academic work builds on hands-on industry experience by developing competencies in statistics, machine learning, database management, and data visualization. I am actively seeking a data scientist position starting in July 2026 where I can apply these skills to patient‑centered problems.  

Outside of work and study, I'm a strength training enthusiast and avid learner of nutrition and physiology. Whether I'm tracking my macros in the gym or analyzing healthcare datasets, my approach is intentional and thorough. I love connecting with others who are interested in the intersection of healthcare, data science and patient centered care, and I'm always eager to explore new opportunities and learn from peers.  

# What I hope to learn  
- **Using Tableau to visualize data** – gaining proficiency in Tableau so I can build interactive dashboards and communicate insights clearly.  
- **Learning different perspectives on how to critique visualizations and be creative in improving them** – developing a critical eye for design and learning to iterate on visualizations using feedback from peers.  
- **Developing clear, compelling narratives with data and conducting user research to ensure those stories resonate** – based on the syllabus, I'm especially interested in crafting persuasive narratives for specific audiences and using user research to make sure my visualizations are effective.  

# Portfolio  

## Assignment 1: Visualizing Government Debt  
[Visualizing Government Debt](visualizing-government-debt)  

In this assignment, I constructed an OECD government debt heatmap (2007–2024) to provide a broad, comparative view of how debt-to-GDP ratios have shifted across countries over time. While the heatmap effectively highlighted overall patterns and periods of rapid change, it was less suited for explaining deeper structural differences among regions.

To address this, my  focuses on a redesigned visualization  examines the long-standing fiscal discipline divide between Northern and Southern Europe. Using the same OECD dataset, I grouped countries into the two regions to illustrate how Northern European economies have generally maintained lower and more stable debt levels, whereas Southern Europe has continued to face elevated debt burdens following the 2008 global financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic.

The redesign uses a dual-line approach: thin lines for individual countries and bold lines for regional averages. This layering enables viewers to see both country-level variability and overarching regional trajectories. I selected teal for Northern Europe and orange for Southern Europe to convey contrasting themes of stability versus fiscal strain, and added a dashed 100% reference line to signal a common debt threshold. Together, these design elements help communicate a clearer narrative of divergence that was less apparent in the heatmap.



## Assignment 2: Critique by Design
[Critique by Design](critique-by-design) 
For Assignment 2, I conducted an in-depth critique and redesign of the "HPV vaccination: How the world can eliminate cervical cancer" visualization series published by Our World in Data. My analysis identified that while individual charts were clear and effective, there was a lack of narrative cohesion and integrated context across the series.

I proposed and implemented a redesign that builds a unified dashboard, connecting key dimensions: national HPV vaccination policy adoption, coverage rates, and cervical cancer outcomes. This involved detailed dataset integration and exploratory analysis, depicted in both a design sketch and interactive Tableau dashboard. My solution features per-country small multiples, combining area charts for cancer risk and line charts for vaccination coverage with marked policy adoption years. User testing with MISM classmates highlighted the need for better value-year alignment, trend line visualization, and reduced comparison clutter, all of which were addressed in the redesign. You can view the full process and final visualization here: [Critique by Design](critique-by-design.md).

*Technical work included*: EDA and dataset cleaning (see [Data preprocessing and EDA_Critique and Redesign.ipynb](Data%20preprocessing%20and%20EDA_Critique%20and%20Redesign.ipynb)), design sketching, and embedding an interactive dashboard.



## Final Project

**Title:** The AI Usage Gap: Are We Really Using AI the Way We Want To?

My final project investigates how artificial intelligence (AI) tools are integrated into daily life, exploring the gap between current usage and user aspirations. The work follows a data-driven narrative:
- Rapid growth of AI users and the increasing expectation of AI skills from employers.
- Survey and interview-based insights on how Americans and graduate students actually use AI versus how they wish it could support them.
- Practical recommendations for closing the "AI usage gap," especially targeting graduate students.

Key steps documented in the repository:
1. **Data Story and Research:** Explores adoption, usage, and the desire for more supportive AI, culminating in a call-to-action for readers ([final-project-part-one.md](final-project-part-one.md)).
2. **Wireframes and User Feedback:** Storyboard and preliminary prototypes tested with graduate students to validate relevance and clarify message ([final-project-part-two.md](final-project-part-two.md)).
3. **Synthesized Design:** Interview findings led to a refined, student-focused approach, with improved pacing, clearer transitions, and actionable recommendations—demonstrated in the final Shorthand site ([final-project-part-three.md](final-project-part-three.md)).

**Featured tools:** Tableau for interactive data visualization, Shorthand for narrative integration, and a suite of AI tools to support learning, note-taking, and job applications.

**Persona & Impact:** The project centers on "overwhelmed graduate students," using relatable storytelling and targeted tool demos to motivate effective AI adoption.
