# About me  
As a life-long learner, my journey from fast-moving consumer goods to medical devices and ultimately pharmaceuticals has been a deliberate path to deepen my understanding of healthcare. With five years of experience across Johnson & Johnson and Merck KGaA, I have immersed myself in anatomy and surgical procedures to support surgeons with targeted solutions and expanded my focus to oncology, gaining a holistic view of the patient journey. These experiences ignited my passion for healthcare policy and analytics and convinced me of the power of data to improve patient outcomes.  

I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Health Care Analytics & Information Technology at Carnegie Mellon University (May 2026) to refine my analytical skills and broaden my impact on patient care. My academic work builds on hands-on industry experience by developing competencies in statistics, machine learning, database management, and data visualization. I am actively seeking a data scientist position starting in July 2026 where I can apply these skills to patient‑centered problems.  

Outside of work and study, I'm a strength training enthusiast and avid learner of nutrition and physiology. Whether I'm tracking my macros in the gym or analyzing healthcare datasets, my approach is intentional and thorough. I love connecting with others who are interested in the intersection of healthcare, data science and patient centered care, and I'm always eager to explore new opportunities and learn from peers.  

# What I hope to learn  
- **Using Tableau to visualize data** – gaining proficiency in Tableau so I can build interactive dashboards and communicate insights clearly.  
- **Learning different perspectives on how to critique visualizations and be creative in improving them** – developing a critical eye for design and learning to iterate on visualizations using feedback from peers.  
- **Developing clear, compelling narratives with data and conducting user research to ensure those stories resonate** – based on the syllabus, I'm especially interested in crafting persuasive narratives for specific audiences and using user research to make sure my visualizations are effective.

## Assignment 1: Visualizing Government Debt  
[Visualizing Government Debt](visualizing-government-debt)  

In this assignment, I constructed an OECD government debt heatmap (2007–2024) to provide a broad, comparative view of how debt-to-GDP ratios have shifted across countries over time. While the heatmap effectively highlighted overall patterns and periods of rapid change, it was less suited for explaining deeper structural differences among regions.

To address this, my  focuses on a redesigned visualization  examines the long-standing fiscal discipline divide between Northern and Southern Europe. Using the same OECD dataset, I grouped countries into the two regions to illustrate how Northern European economies have generally maintained lower and more stable debt levels, whereas Southern Europe has continued to face elevated debt burdens following the 2008 global financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic.

The redesign uses a dual-line approach: thin lines for individual countries and bold lines for regional averages. This layering enables viewers to see both country-level variability and overarching regional trajectories. I selected teal for Northern Europe and orange for Southern Europe to convey contrasting themes of stability versus fiscal strain, and added a dashed 100% reference line to signal a common debt threshold. Together, these design elements help communicate a clearer narrative of divergence that was less apparent in the heatmap.

## Assignment 3  & 4: Critique by Design  
[Critique by Design](critique-by-design)  

This assignment will focus on critiquing an existing visualization and redesigning it for clarity and impact. I'll provide my critique and redesigned visualization on the linked page.  

## Final project  
Stay tuned for my final project! I'll use the tools and techniques learned in this course to create a comprehensive data storytelling piece. I'll provide a high-level description and link once the project is underway.
