# Wireframes / Storyboards  
Below is a walkthrough of my draft Shorthand story, functioning as a **visual storyboard** of the narrative.

### **1. Opening / Context Setting**  
- Hero section with bold headline: *“AI Is Everywhere: Rapid Global Growth of AI Tool Users from 2020–2031.”*  
- Large cover image plus introductory text describing the surge in AI adoption after ChatGPT’s 2022 launch.

### **2. Data Section: Growth of AI Tools**  
- Tableau chart showing AI tool users worldwide (2020–2031).  
- Annotations indicating ChatGPT's launch and the exponential increase afterward.

### **3. Usage Awareness & Behavior**  
- A grid of high-fidelity Datawrapper visuals:  
  - 79% U.S. adults have heard of ChatGPT  
  - 58% of young adults have used an AI tool  
  - 35% use AI at work  
- Second grid highlighting growth in specific uses (+20% work, +18% learning, +11% entertainment).

### **4. Pause Section**  
- A reflection screen: *“Are we using AI tools the right way?”*

### **5. AI Intent vs. Actual Usage**  
- Split-screen layout with 68% stat on text-to-text preference.  
- Supporting paragraph explaining the drop-off in other formats (text-to-image, text-to-video, etc.).

### **6. The Wish and the Gap**  
- Two key insights:  
  - 32% want AI as a personal assistant  
  - 28% want AI to automate daily tasks  
- Accompanied by workplace photos symbolizing desired daily use.

### **7. Recommendations for Graduate Students**  
- Section titled *“What AI Tools Should You Learn?”*  
- Three categories:  
  - **AI as a Learner** → NotebookLM  
  - **AI for Note-taking** → Fathom  
  - **AI for Job Applications** → Simplify, ChatGPT for resumes  

### **8. Call to Action**  
- Encourages graduate students to adopt appropriate AI tools to close the gap between intent and behavior.

# User Research

## Target Audience  
My target audience is **graduate students who intend to use AI tools but may not be using them effectively or consistently**.  
This aligns with feedback from early prototype reviews suggesting that a **student-centered framing** would make the story more actionable and relatable.

### Approach to Identifying Interviewees  
I recruited three individuals across programs in Heinz College:  
- Two students from **MISM** (Master of Information Systems Management)  
- One student from **MEIM** (Entertainment Industry Management)  
All represent typical users who:  
- Are aware of AI tools  
- Have varying levels of adoption  
- Are actively balancing coursework, job searches, and productivity challenges  
Each is familiar with tools like ChatGPT but differs in depth of usage.

# Interview Script  
### Research Goals  
1. Understand how students currently use AI tools for academic and daily tasks.  
2. Identify what they *wish* AI could help them do.  
3. Evaluate whether the draft story structure is clear and relevant to their needs.  
4. Identify missing elements or confusing sections in my storyboard.

### Questions to Ask  
| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
| Understand current usage | “What AI tools do you currently use? For what tasks?” |
| Identify gaps | “Is there anything you *wish* AI could help you with, but currently doesn’t?” |
| Evaluate clarity | “Is the story clear? At what point—if any—did you feel confused or need more context?” |
| Evaluate relevance | “Is this story relevant to your experience?” |
| Gather suggestions | “What part of the storyboard do you think needs improvement?” |

# Interview Findings  

| Questions | Interview 1 — MISM | Interview 2 — PPMDA | Interview 3 — MEIM |
|----------|-------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| **Relevance of framing** | Suggested strongly: “Your reader should be *students*. That makes the recommendations more useful.” | Agreed—story feels tailored to students already. | Suggested adding examples for creative/industry roles. |
| **Clarity of narrative flow** | Flow is smooth; liked the pause section. | Wanted slightly shorter text blocks. | Wanted clearer transition between “wish” and “gap.” |
| **Current AI usage** | Uses ChatGPT for summarizing readings. | Uses Claude and ChatGPT for coding/debugging. | Mostly uses AI for scheduling and email drafting. |
| **Wish for AI capabilities** | “I want AI to help with planning assignments.” | “Better integration across tools.” | “Tools that help organize creative ideas.” |
| **Confusing elements** | None major. | Found the 68% section slightly dense. | Wanted the call-to-action more specific. |

### Cross-Interview Insights  
- All three respondents value **student-oriented examples**.  
- All expressed a desire for **task automation**, supporting the “usage gap” theme.  
- Transitions can be enhanced for smoother reading.  
- Visuals were described as “clear and data-driven,” matching expectations.

# Identified Changes for Part III  

| Research Synthesis | Anticipated Changes for Part III |
|--------------------|----------------------------------|
| Need stronger student framing | Rewrite intro + CTA to explicitly address “graduate students” |
| Some text blocks too dense | Break long paragraphs into shorter chunks |
| 68% section dense | Add icons or micro-visuals to reduce cognitive load |
| Desire for clearer transitions | Add short section headers with “Why this matters” |
| MEIM student noted creative use cases | Add a sidebar or small callout for non-technical students |
| CTA not specific enough | Add direct recommendations + next actions |

---

# Final Thoughts  
The user research validated that the “AI usage gap” is a meaningful and relatable concept for students. The feedback provides a clear direction for improving transitions, clarifying certain sections, and making recommendations more actionable for Part III.
